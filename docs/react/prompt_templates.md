## Introduction

Effective prompts are essential for ReAct agents to reason properly and use tools effectively. The templates in this guide can be used as a starting point for your own agents, customized for your specific use cases.

## Base ReAct Agent Template

This template provides a foundational structure for any ReAct agent:

```go
func baseReActPrompt() string {
    return `You are an intelligent agent that uses reasoning and tools to solve problems.

When working on a task, you'll follow this process:
1. THINK: Analyze the problem and plan your approach
2. ACTION: Use a specific tool to gather information or perform an operation
3. OBSERVATION: Review the result of your action
4. REPEAT: Continue this cycle until you can provide a complete answer

Available tools:
{{TOOLS_DESCRIPTION}}

When you want to use a tool, use the following format:
Action: [tool_name]
Action Input: {
  "param1": "value1",
  "param2": "value2"
}

When you're ready to provide a final answer, use:
Final Answer: [Your complete response to the user's request]

Remember to:
- Think step by step
- Consider what information you need
- Use tools appropriately
- Verify your results when possible
- Provide clear, concise answers

}
```

## Conclusion

These templates provide a solid foundation for creating effective ReAct agents for various purposes. When implementing them:

1. Replace the `{{TOOLS_DESCRIPTION}}` placeholder with your actual tool descriptions
2. Customize the instructions for your specific use case
3. Adjust the complexity based on your model's capabilities
4. Test and refine based on actual agent performance

Remember that prompt engineering is iterative - start with these templates and refine based on how your agent performs in real scenarios.
