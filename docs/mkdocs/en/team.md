# Team

The `team` package is a high-level way to run multiple Agents together.

It gives you two simple collaboration styles:

- **Coordinator Team**: one Agent stays in charge, calls member Agents as
  tools, then replies to the user.
- **Swarm**: no coordinator loop; the current Agent can hand off to another
  Agent via `transfer_to_agent`.

In the examples below, `LLMAgent` is an Agent implementation backed by a
Large Language Model (LLM).

## Why do you need a Team?

An Agent is good at one role. Real applications often need multiple roles,
for example:

- researching a problem
- writing code
- reviewing for mistakes

A Team lets you combine these roles with a small, clear
Application Programming Interface (API).

## Coordinator Team vs Swarm

### Coordinator Team

- **Best for**: combining multiple outputs into one final answer (for example,
  consensus, summarization, "review then revise").
- **How it works**: the coordinator calls members as tools (using AgentTool).
  The coordinator can call multiple members in one run.

```mermaid

    U[User] --> T[Coordinator]
    T -->|tool call| A[Member A]
    T -->|tool call| B[Member B]
    T -->|tool call| C[Member C]
    T --> U
```

### Swarm

- **Best for**: “handoff chains”, where each Agent decides who should act
  next.
- **How it works**: an entry Agent starts, then Agents transfer control to the
  next Agent using `transfer_to_agent`. The final Agent replies to the user.
- **When it ends**: a Swarm ends when an Agent stops calling
  `transfer_to_agent` and returns a normal final answer. The last Agent's
  reply is the result for that run.
- **Is there an automatic summary?**: Swarm does not run an extra
  “global summary” step. If you want a structured wrap-up (summary, decisions,
  next steps), require it in member `instruction`s, or add a dedicated
  “finalizer” Agent and transfer to it at the end.

```mermaid

    participant U as User
    participant A as Agent A
    participant B as Agent B
    participant C as Agent C

    U->>A: prompt
    A->>B: transfer_to_agent
    B->>C: transfer_to_agent
    C->>U: final answer
```

## Quickstart: Coordinator Team

```go
import (
    "trpc.group/trpc-go/trpc-agent-go/agent"
    "trpc.group/trpc-go/trpc-agent-go/agent/llmagent"
    "trpc.group/trpc-go/trpc-agent-go/model/openai"
    "trpc.group/trpc-go/trpc-agent-go/runner"
    "trpc.group/trpc-go/trpc-agent-go/team"
)

modelInstance := openai.New("deepseek-chat")

coder := llmagent.New(
    "coder",
    llmagent.WithModel(modelInstance),
    llmagent.WithInstruction("Write Go code."),
)

reviewer := llmagent.New(
    "reviewer",
    llmagent.WithModel(modelInstance),
    llmagent.WithInstruction("Review for correctness."),
)

coordinator := llmagent.New(
    "team",
    llmagent.WithModel(modelInstance),
    llmagent.WithInstruction(
        "You are the coordinator. Consult the right specialists, "+
            "then produce the final answer.",
    ),
)

tm, err := team.New(
    coordinator,
    []agent.Agent{coder, reviewer},
    team.WithDescription("A tiny coordinator team"),
)
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}

r := runner.NewRunner("app", tm)
_ = r
```

Notes:

- The Team name is derived from the coordinator name (here both are `"team"`;
  `team.New` reuses `coordinator.Info().Name`), so the same session history
  and events don't end up with two different Agent author names.
- The coordinator must support dynamic ToolSets (LLMAgent does).
- In most cases, you do not need to say “call members as tools” in the
  coordinator `instruction`. Team automatically wraps `members` as tools and
  injects them into the coordinator; prefer describing responsibilities and the
  expected output.
- If you want to stream member output in the parent transcript, enable
  streaming for both the coordinator and members, then set member tool
  configuration (see below).

## Team Inside Team (Hierarchical Teams)

Because `team.Team` also implements the `agent.Agent` interface, you can
reuse it like any other Agent: one Team can be a member of another Team.

This “Team of Teams” structure is useful when you want a clear hierarchy,
for example:

- `project_manager`
  - `dev_team`
    - `backend_dev`
    - `frontend_dev`
  - `doc_writer`

Minimal example: the outer coordinator Team (`project_manager`) calls the
inner Team (`dev_team`) as a single member tool.

```go
import (
    "trpc.group/trpc-go/trpc-agent-go/agent"
    "trpc.group/trpc-go/trpc-agent-go/agent/llmagent"
    "trpc.group/trpc-go/trpc-agent-go/model/openai"
    "trpc.group/trpc-go/trpc-agent-go/runner"
    "trpc.group/trpc-go/trpc-agent-go/team"
)

modelInstance := openai.New("deepseek-chat")

backendDev := llmagent.New(
    "backend_dev",
    llmagent.WithModel(modelInstance),
    llmagent.WithInstruction("Design service interfaces and server-side logic."),
)

frontendDev := llmagent.New(
    "frontend_dev",
    llmagent.WithModel(modelInstance),
    llmagent.WithInstruction("Design user interfaces and client-side logic."),
)

devCoordinator := llmagent.New(
    "dev_team",
    llmagent.WithModel(modelInstance),
    llmagent.WithInstruction(
        "You lead dev_team. Collect input from your members when needed, "+
            "then return an integrated technical plan.",
    ),
)

devTeam, err := team.New(
    devCoordinator,
    []agent.Agent{backendDev, frontendDev},
)
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}

docWriter := llmagent.New(
    "doc_writer",
    llmagent.WithModel(modelInstance),
    llmagent.WithInstruction("Write clear documentation."),
)

pmCoordinator := llmagent.New(
    "project_manager",
    llmagent.WithModel(modelInstance),
    llmagent.WithInstruction(
        "You are the project manager. Delegate technical work to dev_team "+
            "and docs to doc_writer, then produce the final answer.",
    ),
)

pmTeam, err := team.New(
    pmCoordinator,
    []agent.Agent{devTeam, docWriter}, // devTeam is a Team.
)
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}

r := runner.NewRunner("app", pmTeam)
_ = r
```

Notes:

- Within one Team, member `Info().Name` values must be unique.
- Prefer names that match `^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$` for maximum tool name
  compatibility across models.
- Swarm (`team.NewSwarm`) requires every member to support `SetSubAgents`.
  `team.Team` does not implement `SetSubAgents`, so using a Team as a Swarm
  member is not supported.
  - If you want “outer coordination + inner handoffs”, make the outer layer
    a coordinator Team (`team.New`), and make the inner layer a Swarm Team
    (`team.NewSwarm`), then use the inner Team as an outer member.

## Member Tool Configuration (Coordinator Teams)

In a coordinator team, each member is wrapped as an AgentTool and installed on
the coordinator as a Tool (via a ToolSet). `team.MemberToolConfig` controls
how that wrapper behaves.

Under the hood, `team.MemberToolConfig` maps directly to AgentTool options:
`agenttool.WithStreamInner`, `agenttool.WithHistoryScope`, and
`agenttool.WithSkipSummarization`.

### Quickstart

Start from defaults, then override what you need:

```go
memberCfg := team.DefaultMemberToolConfig()
memberCfg.StreamInner = true
memberCfg.HistoryScope = team.HistoryScopeParentBranch
memberCfg.SkipSummarization = false

tm, err := team.New(
    coordinator,
    members,
    team.WithMemberToolConfig(memberCfg),
)
```

Defaults (from `team.DefaultMemberToolConfig()`):

- `StreamInner=false`
- `HistoryScope=team.HistoryScopeParentBranch`
- `SkipSummarization=false`

### Options and When to Use Them

#### `StreamInner`

- **Default**: `false`
- **What it does**: forwards member streaming events to the parent flow.
- **Use it when**: you want a “live” transcript showing what each member is
  producing as it streams.
- **How to use it**: enable streaming for the coordinator and members (for
  example, `GenerationConfig{Stream: true}`), then set
  `MemberToolConfig.StreamInner=true`.

#### `HistoryScope`

`HistoryScope` controls whether a member run can see the coordinator's
conversation history.

- `team.HistoryScopeParentBranch` (default)
  - **What it does**: the member inherits the coordinator's history (user
    input, coordinator messages, prior member tool results), but still writes
    its own events into a sub-branch.
  - **Use it when**: members need shared context and handoffs like
    “research first, then write using research”.
- `team.HistoryScopeIsolated`
  - **What it does**: the member is isolated; it primarily sees the tool input
    for this call, not the coordinator's prior history.
  - **Use it when**: you want stronger isolation, smaller prompts, or to avoid
    leaking earlier context into a specialist member.

#### `SkipSummarization`

- **Default**: `false`
- **What it does**: ends the coordinator invocation right after the member
  tool returns, skipping the coordinator's post-tool LLM call.
- **Use it when**: you want “members respond directly” behavior (no coordinator
  synthesis). This can be useful for router/passthrough-style teams where the
  coordinator only selects who should answer.
- **Avoid it when**: you need the coordinator to combine multiple member
  outputs into one final answer (the default coordinator team pattern).

## Parallel Member Calls (Coordinator Teams)

Because members are exposed as tools, you can enable parallel tool execution on
the coordinator:

```go
coordinator := llmagent.New(
    "team",
    llmagent.WithEnableParallelTools(true),
)
```

This runs multiple tool calls concurrently **only when the model emits multiple
tool calls in a single response**. Use this when:

- member tasks are independent (for example, “analyze market”, “analyze risk”,
  “analyze competitors”)
- you want to reduce end-to-end latency

## Quickstart: Swarm

```go
tm, err := team.NewSwarm(
    "team",
    "researcher", // entrypoint member name
    []agent.Agent{coder, researcher, reviewer},
)
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
```

Notes:

- `entryName` is the Swarm entrypoint: a run starts from this member. It must
  exist in `members` (it must match the member's `Info().Name`).
- Members must support `SetSubAgents` (LLMAgent does). This is required so
  members can discover and transfer to each other.

### Cross-request transfer (optional)

By default, each new user message starts from the Swarm entry member
(`entryName`), even if the previous message ended after one or more handoffs.

If you want the "current owner" of the conversation to persist across user
messages, enable cross-request transfer:

```go
tm, err := team.NewSwarm(
    "team",
    "researcher",
    members,
    team.WithCrossRequestTransfer(true),
)
```

With this enabled, after a handoff, the next user message will start from the
Agent that produced the last reply (until another `transfer_to_agent` happens).
This feature is implemented via session state, so you must reuse the same
session across requests.

## Swarm Guardrails

Swarm-style handoffs can loop if Agents keep transferring back and forth.
`team.SwarmConfig` provides optional limits (a zero value means "no limit" or
"disabled"):

- `MaxHandoffs`: maximum transfers in one run (across the whole Team; each
  `transfer_to_agent` counts as 1)
- `NodeTimeout`: maximum runtime for the target Agent after a transfer (only
  applies to transfer targets)
- `RepetitiveHandoffWindow` + `RepetitiveHandoffMinUnique`: loop detection
  (sliding window)

Tip: set either `RepetitiveHandoffWindow` or `RepetitiveHandoffMinUnique` to 0
to disable loop detection (no "last N transfers" check).

```go
import "time"

tm, err := team.NewSwarm(
    "team",
    "researcher",
    members,
    team.WithSwarmConfig(team.SwarmConfig{
        MaxHandoffs:                20,
        NodeTimeout:                300 * time.Second,
        RepetitiveHandoffWindow:    8,
        RepetitiveHandoffMinUnique: 3,
    }),
)
```

Defaults come from `team.DefaultSwarmConfig()`: `MaxHandoffs=20`,
`RepetitiveHandoffWindow=8`, `RepetitiveHandoffMinUnique=3`, and
`NodeTimeout=0` (no timeout).

Loop detection meaning: with a window size N and a minimum unique count M, if
the last N transfer targets (toAgent) contain fewer than M unique Agents, the
transfer is rejected. This is a coarse but efficient heuristic: it only looks
at recent target Agent names, not the full transfer path.

Example: if `RepetitiveHandoffWindow=8` and `RepetitiveHandoffMinUnique=3`,
and transfers keep bouncing between A and B (A => B, B => A, ...), then the
last 8 transfer targets contain only 2 unique Agents, which is less than 3,
so the transfer is rejected.

Note: if you set M to 2, the A↔B "ping-pong" will NOT be blocked (because the
unique count is exactly 2, not fewer than 2). To cover this case, set M to 3
or higher.

## Example

See `examples/team/coord` (Coordinator Team) and `examples/team/swarm` (Swarm)
for runnable demos.

## Design Notes

- Coordinator teams expose members as tools by installing AgentTool wrappers on
  the coordinator.
- Swarm teams wire members together via `SetSubAgents` and rely on
  `transfer_to_agent` for handoffs.
- `team.SwarmConfig` is enforced by a transfer controller stored in
  `RunOptions.RuntimeState` during a run.
