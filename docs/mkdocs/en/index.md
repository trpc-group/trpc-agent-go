# tRPC-Agent-Go: Empowering Go Developers to Build Intelligent AI Applications

## 1. Project Introduction

The tRPC team previously open-sourced the A2A development framework [tRPC-A2A-Go](https://github.com/trpc-group/trpc-a2a-go) and MCP development framework [tRPC-MCP-Go](https://github.com/trpc-group/trpc-mcp-go). Especially tRPC-A2A-Go has gained many users and contributors both domestically and internationally. Now we are launching the [tRPC-Agent-Go](https://github.com/trpc-group/trpc-agent-go) development framework to complete the Go language AI ecosystem development framework.

Most mainstream Agent frameworks (AutoGen, CrewAI, Agno, ADK, etc.) are Python-based, while Go has natural advantages in microservices, concurrency, and deployment. Go also has large-scale applications within Tencent, and there are relatively few Agent frameworks based on Go in the industry. Most are orchestrated workflow frameworks, lacking true "decentralized, collaborative, emergent" autonomous multi-Agent capabilities. tRPC-Agent-Go directly leverages Go's high concurrency and tRPC ecosystem to bring LLM reasoning, negotiation, and adaptability to Go scenarios, meeting complex business requirements for both "intelligence + performance".

## 2. Architecture Design

tRPC-Agent-Go adopts a modular architecture design, consisting of multiple core components that are all pluggable. Component communication is decoupled through an event-driven mechanism, supporting callback insertion for custom logic:

- Agent: Core execution unit, responsible for processing user input and generating responses
- Runner: Agent executor, responsible for managing execution flow and connecting Session/Memory Service capabilities
- Model: Supports multiple LLM models (OpenAI, DeepSeek, etc.)
- Tool: Provides various tool capabilities (Function, MCP, DuckDuckGo, etc.)
- Session: Manages user session state and events
- Memory: Records user long-term memory and personalized information
- Knowledge: Implements RAG knowledge retrieval capabilities
- Planner: Provides Agent planning and reasoning capabilities

Below is the architecture diagram of each component:

## 3. Core Features

Diverse Agent System

- LLMAgent: Based on large language models, supports tool calling and reasoning
- ChainAgent: Chain execution, supports multi-step task decomposition
- ParallelAgent: Parallel processing, supports multi-expert collaboration
- CycleAgent: Iterative loops, supports self-optimization
- GraphAgent: Graph workflow, compatible with existing orchestration habits

Rich Tool Ecosystem

- Built-in common tools
- Supports multiple extension methods like Function, MCP protocol
- Flexible tool combination and calling strategies

Intelligent Session Management

- Supports Redis and in-memory storage for session persistence
- Long-term memory and personalized information retention
- RAG retrieval-augmented generation capabilities
- Real-time event-driven architecture

End-to-End Observability

- OpenTelemetry full-link tracing and performance monitoring
- Visual debugging interface and real-time monitoring
- Structured logging and error tracking

## 4. Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"log"

	"trpc.group/trpc-go/trpc-agent-go/agent/llmagent"
	"trpc.group/trpc-go/trpc-agent-go/model"
	"trpc.group/trpc-go/trpc-agent-go/model/openai"
	"trpc.group/trpc-go/trpc-agent-go/runner"
	"trpc.group/trpc-go/trpc-agent-go/tool"
	"trpc.group/trpc-go/trpc-agent-go/tool/function"
)

func main() {
	// Create model.
	modelInstance := openai.New("deepseek-chat")

	// Create tool.
	calculatorTool := function.NewFunctionTool(
		calculator,
		function.WithName("calculator"),
		function.WithDescription("Execute addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. "+
			"Parameters: a, b are numeric values, op takes values add/sub/mul/div; "+
			"returns result as the calculation result."),
	)

	// Enable streaming output.
	genConfig := model.GenerationConfig{
		Stream: true,
	}

	// Create Agent.
	agent := llmagent.New("assistant",
		llmagent.WithModel(modelInstance),
		llmagent.WithTools([]tool.Tool{calculatorTool}),
		llmagent.WithGenerationConfig(genConfig),
	)

	// Create Runner.
	runner := runner.NewRunner("calculator-app", agent)

	// Execute conversation.
	ctx := context.Background()
	events, err := runner.Run(ctx,
		"user-001",
		"session-001",
		model.NewUserMessage("Calculate what 2+3 equals"),
	)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	// Process event stream.
	for event := range events {
		if event.Object == "chat.completion.chunk" {
			fmt.Print(event.Choices[0].Delta.Content)
		}
	}
	fmt.Println()
}

func calculator(ctx context.Context, req calculatorReq) (calculatorRsp, error) {
	var result float64
	switch req.Op {
	case "add", "+":
		result = req.A + req.B
	case "sub", "-":
		result = req.A - req.B
	case "mul", "*":
		result = req.A * req.B
	case "div", "/":
		result = req.A / req.B
	}
	return calculatorRsp{Result: result}, nil
}

type calculatorReq struct {
	A  float64 `json:"a"`
	B  float64 `json:"b"`
	Op string  `json:"op"`
}

type calculatorRsp struct {
	Result float64 `json:"result"`
}
```

### Multi-Agent Collaboration Example

```go
// Create chain Agent.
chainAgent := chainagent.New("problem-solver",
    chainagent.WithSubAgents([]agent.Agent{
        analysisAgent,   // Analysis Agent.
        executionAgent,  // Execution Agent.
    }))

// Use Runner to execute.
runner := runner.NewRunner("multi-agent-app", chainAgent)
events, _ := runner.Run(ctx, userID, sessionID, message)
```

## 5. Acknowledgments

Thanks to Tencent internal businesses such as Tencent Yuanbao, Tencent Video, Tencent News, IMA, QQ Music, and other businesses for their support. Business scenario refinement is the best validation for the framework.

Thanks to excellent open-source frameworks like ADK, Agno, CrewAI, AutoGen, etc., for their inspiration, providing ideas for tRPC-Agent-Go development.
