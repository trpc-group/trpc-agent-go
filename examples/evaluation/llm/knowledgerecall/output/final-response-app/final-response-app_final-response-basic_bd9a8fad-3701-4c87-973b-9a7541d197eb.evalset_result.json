It transforms how developers create AI applications by enabling the creation of autonomous agents that can:\n\n- **Think** - Process information and make decisions\n- **Remember** - Maintain state and context across interactions  \n- **Collaborate** - Work together with other agents or systems\n- **Act** - Execute tasks and perform actions\n\nThe framework is designed to make building AI applications with autonomous agent capabilities easier and more efficient. It appears to be part of the tRPC ecosystem (likely related to Tencent's RPC framework) but specifically focused on AI agent development in Go.\n\nThe framework seems to be positioned as a tool for developers who want to create sophisticated AI-powered applications with agent capabilities without having to build all the underlying infrastructure from scratch."
