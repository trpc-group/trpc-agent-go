# tRPC-Agent-Go     Framework

tRPC-Agent-Go is     a powerful     AI agent framework.					It provides comprehensive     tools for building intelligent applications.

## Key Features

xxxxx     The framework supports     multiple agent types:

1. LLMAgent -					Basic language model     agent
2. ChainAgent -     Sequential     execution					of tasks
3. ParallelAgent -     Concurrent					processing xxxxx
4. CycleAgent -					Loop-based     execution
5. GraphAgent -     Complex     workflow					management

## Architecture					Overview

The framework     follows a     modular design:

- **Agent Layer**:     Core execution     units
- **Knowledge Layer**:					Document processing     and retrieval
- **Tool Layer**:     External					integrations     xxxxx
- **Memory Layer**:					Session and     conversation     management

## Getting     Started					xxxxx

First,     install the     framework:

```bash
go get     trpc.group/trpc-go/trpc-agent-go
```

Then,					create your     first agent:

```go
agent :=     llmagent.New(					model,
    llmagent.WithInstruction("Be     helpful"),
)
```
