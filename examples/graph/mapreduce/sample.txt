Go (Golang) is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google. It is known for its simplicity, built-in concurrency primitives (goroutines, channels), fast compilation, and strong standard library. Go encourages clear code structure, composition over inheritance, and provides powerful tooling such as gofmt, go vet, and go test.

Goroutines are lightweight threads managed by the Go runtime. You can start a goroutine by prefixing a function call with the go keyword. Channels enable communication and synchronization between goroutines. Buffered channels can store a limited number of elements, while unbuffered channels synchronize senders and receivers. The select statement allows waiting on multiple channel operations, enabling patterns like fan-in, fan-out, and timeouts.

Although concurrency is a core strength, developers should pay attention to data races and shared-state coordination. Go provides sync.Mutex and sync.RWMutex for mutual exclusion and sync.WaitGroup for waiting on goroutines. The context package is the standard mechanism for cancellation and timeouts across API boundaries and goroutines. Avoid using global variables for shared state; prefer passing explicit dependencies and using channels or properly synchronized data structures.

In production systems, use structured logging and instrumentation to observe goroutine lifecycles and channel usage. Beware of goroutine leaks: always ensure goroutines can exit (for example, by respecting context cancellation), and drain channels or close them appropriately. Design APIs that surface errors and support backpressure. Consider using worker pools or bounded concurrency to protect downstream services. Finally, write tests that exercise concurrent code under varying loads and ensure deterministic behavior where necessary.
