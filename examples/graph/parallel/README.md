# Parallel Execution Graph Example

This example demonstrates parallel execution in graph workflows using the `trpc-agent-go` library. It shows how to create graphs with multiple edges from the same node and execute nodes in parallel.

## Overview

The parallel execution workflow processes text input through multiple parallel paths:

1. **Preprocessing** - Validates and prepares input text
2. **Analysis** - Analyzes text content using LLM and tools
3. **Parallel Processing** - Routes to three parallel nodes:
   - **Summarize** - Creates concise summaries
   - **Enhance** - Improves content quality
   - **Classify** - Categorizes content
4. **Aggregation** - Collects results from parallel nodes
5. **Output Formatting** - Formats final results

## Key Features

### 🔄 Multiple Edges from Same Node
The example demonstrates how to create multiple edges from a single routing node:
```go
// Add multiple edges from the routing node to parallel nodes
stateGraph.AddEdge("route_to_parallel", "summarize")
stateGraph.AddEdge("route_to_parallel", "enhance") 
stateGraph.AddEdge("route_to_parallel", "classify")
```

### 📊 Parallel Execution Tracking
- Tracks execution order of nodes
- Monitors performance of parallel nodes
- Aggregates results from multiple paths

### 🔍 Enhanced Debugging
- Comprehensive logging for parallel execution
- Tool input/output display
- Model execution metadata
- Performance monitoring

## Graph Structure

```
preprocess → analyze → tools → route_to_parallel
                                    ↓
                    ┌───────────────┼───────────────┐
                    ↓               ↓               ↓
                summarize       enhance        classify
                    ↓               ↓               ↓
                    └───────────────┼───────────────┘
                                    ↓
                              aggregate → format_output
```

## Usage

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.21 or later
- Access to an LLM model (default: deepseek-v4-flash)

### Running the Example

```bash
# Navigate to the parallel example directory
cd trpc-agent-go/examples/graph/parallel

# Run with default model
go run main.go

# Run with specific model
go run main.go -model deepseek-v4-flash
```

### Interactive Mode

The example runs in interactive mode where you can:

1. **Enter text** - Process any text through the parallel workflow
2. **View execution** - See real-time execution of parallel nodes
3. **Monitor performance** - Track execution times and order
4. **Analyze results** - View aggregated results from all parallel paths

### Example Commands

```
📄 Text: This is a sample text for parallel processing
```

The workflow will:
- Preprocess the input
- Analyze content using LLM and tools
- Route to three parallel processing nodes
- Execute summarize, enhance, and classify simultaneously
- Aggregate all results
- Display formatted output

## Key Insights

### Parallel Execution Behavior
- **Concurrent Processing**: Multiple nodes can execute simultaneously
- **Order Independence**: Parallel nodes may complete in different orders
- **Result Aggregation**: All parallel results are collected before proceeding

### Debugging Features
- **Execution Tracking**: Complete order of node execution
- **Performance Monitoring**: Execution times for each node
- **Detailed Logging**: Input/output for tools and models
- **State Management**: Proper state passing between nodes

### Graph Design Patterns
- **Fan-out Pattern**: Single node routes to multiple parallel nodes
- **Fan-in Pattern**: Multiple parallel nodes converge to aggregation
- **Conditional Routing**: Dynamic routing based on analysis results

## Testing Parallel Execution

This example is designed to test:

1. **Multiple Edge Support**: Verify that multiple edges from the same node work correctly
2. **Parallel Execution**: Confirm that nodes can execute in parallel
3. **State Management**: Ensure proper state passing in parallel scenarios
4. **Result Aggregation**: Test collection and combination of parallel results
5. **Error Handling**: Verify error propagation in parallel execution

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Sequential Execution**: If nodes appear to execute sequentially instead of in parallel, check:
   - Graph compilation errors
   - Node dependencies
   - Resource constraints

2. **Missing Results**: If some parallel results are missing:
   - Check node execution logs
   - Verify state key names
   - Ensure proper result aggregation

3. **Performance Issues**: If parallel execution is slow:
   - Monitor individual node performance
   - Check for blocking operations
   - Verify resource availability

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Run with verbose logging
go run main.go -model deepseek-v4-flash -verbose

# Fake streaming is enabled by default.
# Disable fake streaming
go run main.go -model deepseek-v4-flash -stream=false

# Customize streaming feel (chunk size and delay)
go run main.go -model deepseek-v4-flash -stream -stream-chunk 12 -stream-delay 40ms

# Check for compilation errors
go build main.go

# Run tests (if available)
go test -v
```

## Contributing

When modifying this example:

1. **Maintain Parallel Structure**: Keep the fan-out/fan-in pattern
2. **Add Debugging**: Include comprehensive logging for parallel execution
