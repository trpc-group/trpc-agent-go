# Graph Invocation Placeholder Demo

This example demonstrates using `{invocation:*}` placeholders in a graph-based
workflow (StateGraph + GraphAgent + Runner).

Unlike session placeholders (`{key}`, `{user:*}`, `{temp:*}`), invocation
placeholders read from invocation-scoped state (`invocation.SetState`). That
state lives only for the current run and is not stored in the session.

## Features

- A graph with a single LLM node
- `{invocation:request_id}` and `{invocation:case?}` placeholders in the LLM
  instruction
- A BeforeAgent callback that sets invocation state for each run
- An interactive command-line loop with streaming output

## Build

```
go build -o graph-invocation-placeholder main.go
```

## Run

```
./graph-invocation-placeholder
# or select a model
./graph-invocation-placeholder -model deepseek-chat
```

## Commands

- Set Case for the next run:
  ```bash
  /case case-1
  ```
- Clear Case:
  ```bash
  /clear-case
  ```
- Show session state (invocation state is not stored here):
  ```bash
  /show-state
  ```
- Help:
  ```bash
  /help
  ```
- Exit:
  ```bash
  exit
  ```

## Notes

- `RequestID` is generated by Runner for each run and copied into invocation
  state by the BeforeAgent callback.
- `{invocation:case?}` is optional. If Case is not set, it becomes an empty
  string.
