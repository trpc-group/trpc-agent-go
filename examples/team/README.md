# Team Examples

This directory contains two separate, runnable examples for the `team` package:

- `examples/team/coord`: coordinator Team (best for a single final deliverable)
- `examples/team/swarm`: Swarm Team (best for group discussion and handoffs)

Each example has its own `main.go` and `README.md` with usage instructions.
