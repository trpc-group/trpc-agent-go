INDEX:002 | SUBSECTION: 1.1 [REQUIRED] Formatting | All code must be formatted using `gofmt`.
INDEX:003 | SUBSECTION: 1.2 [RECOMMENDED] Line Breaks | It is recommended that a line of code should not exceed `120 columns`. If exceeded, use reasonable line breaking methods. Exceptions: function signatures (though this might indicate you need to reconsider if too many parameters are being passed), long string literals (if they contain newline characters `\n`, consider using raw string literals `` `raw string literal` ``), import module statements, tool-generated code, struct tags
